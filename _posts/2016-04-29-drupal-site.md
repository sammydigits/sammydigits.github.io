I successfully delivered a 9-month long project to rebuild our corporate website using Drupal, hosted on Acquia, served by Akamai. 

I built the entire site, fully responive theme, templates, setup and configuration from start to finish.

We collaborated with a local Chicago design consultancy and placed strong emphasis on performance, UX, and brand guidelines.

Acquia has proven to be an excellent platform and a pleasure to work with. I also utilized the WhiteHouse.gov Akamai module for Drupal.

Ongoing work will include custom module development. Contribution to the Drupal open source infrastucture begins here.
