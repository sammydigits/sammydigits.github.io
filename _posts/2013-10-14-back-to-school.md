It’s back to school season so I’m joining the kids and doing some learning.

I’m earning badges on things like javascript, github, php and css over at [Treehouse](http://referrals.trhou.se/samthompson). So far I’ve found it to be an excellent way of learning some of the basics that I missed the first time round, particularly on the javascript front!
