As a Google partner, we were asigned a Google UX expert (she really was excellent!) to evaluate our top 5 pages. Good news, we're doing a great job, but she found some areas of improvment and made some awesome suggestions. Next it is my job to implement all her suggestions using Optimizely A/B testing.
