Using the YouTube Data API combined with the excellent (Slick)[https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick] carousel, I whipped up an Adobe CQ component (for version 5.6.1) which allows the user to specify a YouTube playlist and have the results displayed as a scrollable list, with lazy loading and options for auto scrolling, speed and delay.
