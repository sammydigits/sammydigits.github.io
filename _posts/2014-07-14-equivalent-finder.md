Having recently moved from the UK to the US, I discovered all the differences in the words we use, like trousers and pants for example. This meant my weekend project had to be a solution to this problem, so I created [EquivalentFinder.com](http://www.equivalentfinder.com) â€“ a database of US words and their UK equivalents. I also included food and retail stores. The site is built on WordPress and uses mark down for easy editing.
