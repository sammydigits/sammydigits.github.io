In June 2013 my colleagues and I launched the new, totally redesigned and rebuilt, IG website, which was many months in the making. Built on the Adobe CQ platform, I worked on the front end and used LESS for the first time, and also tinkered with some JSP behind the scenes. I built the "footer" and "link list" CQ components.
