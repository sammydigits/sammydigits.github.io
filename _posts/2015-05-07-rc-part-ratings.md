Over the weekend I launched my latest side-project, aimed at the world of RC hobbyists (which I am).

The site provides ratings and reviews for all the parts required to build multirotor flying machines (drones), and most importantly allows users to create "build lists" of their preferred parts. These lists can then be shared with others and rated.

In future I plan to expand the site to include other areas of RC, like planes, helicopters, boats and cars.

The site is a webapp, it uses Parse.com as a backend and is completely written by myself, in javascript, using the Parse Javascript API.
